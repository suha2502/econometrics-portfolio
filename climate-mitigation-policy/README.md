# The Environmental Impact of a Denim Tax

**Institution:** University of Toronto, Department of Economics  
**Course:** ECO481: Special Topics in Economics with Data Analytics – Climate Economics  
**Instructor:** Jeffrey Sun

## Overview

This research investigates how a hypothetical Pigouvian tax on Canadian denim jeans would affect their production, water usage, and carbon emissions. Time-series data on global denim fabric imports from the World Integrated Trade Solution are used to construct jeans-level price and quantity estimates. Published life-cycle environmental cost factors serve as inputs for counterfactual models projecting ecological benefits from internalizing the external costs of denim production. A first-differenced log-log demand model estimates a short-run own-price elasticity of -1.57. Applying a +20% price shock—calibrated to carbon and water costs—in 2023 predicts a 24% decline in demand from 2022, translating into savings of 0.5 tonnes CO₂-eq emissions and 61 million litres of water. Simplifying assumptions, necessitated by limited public market data and a partial-equilibrium methodology, temper confidence in these first-order approximations. Policy implementation, feasibility, and associated trade-offs are rigorously evaluated.

## Motivation

This project was the culmination of a semester-long course where I independently designed an original mitigation policy from the ground up. It offered a unique opportunity to meld together my interests in fashion and sustainability in an economic framework, exploring policy levers to alleviate the tension between denim's cultural allure and its material reality as one of the planet's most resource-intensive textiles. I sought to quantify the effects of corrective pricing in this market, and to understand whether it could precipitate responsible redirection in an industry emblematic of waste. Given the advent of fast fashion and influencer culture, this study offers one perspective on how policy design can mitigate socially irresponsible consumption by tethering it to personal responsibility.
