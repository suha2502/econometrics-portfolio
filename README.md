This repository showcases several works highlighting my data analysis skills. I am endlessly grateful to my professors at the University of Toronto for allowing me to throw some scholarly weight, albeit primitive, behind my curiosity towards tackling intriguing issues with technical rigour. I'll be uploading more projects here as I take them onâ€”watch this space. :)
